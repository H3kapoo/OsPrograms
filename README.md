# OsPrograms
Some programs to solve Operating Systems course exercises ;)
## Process Scheduling
#### Available algorithms
**RR** (Round Robin) <br/> **SJF** (Shortest Job First) <br/> **SRTN** (Shortest Running Time Next) <br/> **FCFS** (First Come First Served)
#### How to feed the program
The program reads data from the file ```scData.txt``` as follows: <br/>
| Arrival    | Burst    |
|------------|----------|
| P1 Arrival | P1 Burst |
| ...        | ...      |
| Pn Arrival | Pn Burst |

#### What the program computes
```1.Process queue log``` <br/>
```2.GRANTT diagram``` <br/>
```3.Turn around time and Wait time for each process``` <br/>
```4.Avg turn around / wait time / response time``` <br/>
```5.Context switches```
